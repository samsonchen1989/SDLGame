Write game with <SDL Game Development>

You can find the book in
http://www.packtpub.com/simple-directmedia-layer-game-development/book
Leave your email in "Support" sheet PacktPub will send the book's code
to you for free.

This book tells more than how to use SDL API but teach you how to
write a simple C++ 2D Game Engine.

Maybe the little framework code seems no use for experienced game
coder, but this works fine for beginner like me.

There are many reconstructions in the framework code during the book,
like making it more OOP or more efficient. Record it using Git is a
good idea because changes in the code sometimes are more valuable than
the final code.

Focus on progress but not the result, maybe this is one
fascination of Git as well.
